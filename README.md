# git-practice
This repository is created as part of a Git learning exercise. It demonstrates the following:

- Creating a public repository on GitHub.
- Making changes using the GitHub GUI.
- Cloning the repository to a local machine.
- Making local changes using the CLI.
- Working with branches, tags, and .gitignore.
- Pushing changes from local to remote.

## Key Actions in This Repository:
- Created and modified files like `example.txt` and `test.txt`.
- Worked with multiple branches (`feature-1`, `feature-2`, `hotfix-1`).
- Added tags (e.g., `v1.0`, `v1.1`).
- Ignored certain files using `.gitignore`.
